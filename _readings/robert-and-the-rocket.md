A lot of noise was coming from Robert's garage.
Robert was making a rocket.
At last the banging stopped. Robert was ready to blast off to the moon in his new, red rocket.
Higher and higher went the rocket with Robert inside.
The Earth became smaller and smaller. Outside it became darker and darker.
Robert looked out of his window and he saw...
a falling star.
THUMP! at last he landed.
He was on the moon.
Robert looked out of the window and to his surprise he saw...
A moon monster - a vert bug moon monster with one very big eye. It looked angry.
Robert was so scared that he quickly took off in his red rocket.
He left the moon and the ugly moon monster far behind him.
Before you could say 'Monster', he was back home again...
already planning his next adventure.
